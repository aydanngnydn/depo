  <p>As enterprises around the globe aim to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, cloud computing has emerged as a preferred delivery model due to its service focus and scalability. To fully leverage AI, companies must re-architect their data and move applications into a centralized and secure environment.</p>
<p>Erik Duffield, CEO of Hakkoda, emphasizes the importance of having a solid data strategy to support AI initiatives. He notes that AI is creating competitive pressures for businesses to organize their data efficiently. If organizations fail to manage their data speedily and effectively, they risk missing out on the advantages AI has to offer.</p>
<p>Solution providers play a critical role in assisting customers with their AI objectives by facilitating the migration of data and workloads to cloud environments. Many large clients, particularly in the financial and healthcare sectors, are transitioning to the cloud as part of their AI strategies. Duffield mentions that having data in the cloud offers significant scalability and performance benefits.</p>
<p>Kevin Ichhpurani from Google Cloud highlights that customers typically consider around 80 use cases for AI, but a common data framework is essential for successful implementation. He points out that eliminating data silos and organizing data are major obstacles for businesses adopting new AI-driven models.</p>
<p>Tyler Prince from Snowflake echoes a similar sentiment, stating that successful AI implementation requires centralized and secure data sharing. After partners demonstrate AI proofs of concept, clients often inquire how to prepare their systems for these applications.</p>
<p>Ben Kessler of 66degrees observes many customers beginning their AI journeys with cloud migration, emphasizing the importance of having data in the cloud to deploy effective analytics applications. He notes a rising demand for building AI and GenAI applications along with modernizing data infrastructures.</p>
<p>Research from Gartner predicts that more than 70% of enterprises will utilize industry cloud platforms by 2027 to propel their AI initiatives, up from less than 15% in 2023. Furthermore, it is expected that by 2026, over 80% of enterprises will engage with generative AI APIs and deploy AI-enabled applications in production settings.</p>
<p>The predictions underline the urgency for solution providers to modernize clients&rsquo; data systems since many organizations currently lack the necessary infrastructure to utilize AI effectively. This modernization is critical for tapping into the transformative potential of AI.</p>
